					<p> 
					A proficient but emotionally reserved captain in the Korean People's Army who is stationed along the North Korean DMZ. He is well-respected by the unit he leads and the locals of the rural village he resides in. While he comes from a powerful political family (his father is the director of the General Political Bureau), he prefers to keep his lineage secret. A piano prodigy, he was studying to become a concert pianist in Switzerland before being forced to join the North Korean military after his older brother (with whom he was very close) died in a mysterious car accident. He hides and protects Se-ri after she accidentally crash-lands in his patrol territory. As he tries to help Se-ri find her way back into South Korea, he begins to fall in love with her.

				<p>
				 A South Korean chaebol[5] heiress to the Queen’s Group Chaebol. She has a troubled family history as she is her father's illegitimate child (though he loves her), resulting in a strained relationship with her step-mother due to a childhood misunderstanding and upcoming family succession battle, the latter making her the target of resentment from her half-brothers and their wives. After an aborted marriage engagement, she has had numerous casual relationships with celebrities, but not developed any close companionship. She is nonetheless an independently wealthy businesswoman who runs her own successful fashion and beauty company, Se-ri's Choice. She is known for being a demanding boss, staging publicity stunts, and is a picky eater. She meets Ri Jeong-hyeok after accidentally crash-landing in North Korea due to a paragliding accident. She falls in love with Jeong-hyeok as he shelters her in the North Korean village, where she becomes close to the ajummas and four of his soldiers.

				<p> 
				An intelligent, charming, but poor South Korean conman with British citizenship. After his family was bankrupted by Se-ri's father, he ingratiated himself with Se-ri's brother, Se-hyung, in order to embezzle from the Yoon family's company. Se-hyung attempted to marry off Se-ri to Seung-joon in order to be rid of her, but Se-ri sensed Sung-joon's ill intentions on their first meeting and rejected him. Seung-joon nonetheless successfully cheated a fortune from the Yoon's firm under Se-yung's watch, and fled to North Korea to avoid arrest, while pursued by gangsters hired by Se-hyung.
